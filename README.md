single-page-angularjs-with-login-template
=========================================

An AngularJS one-page site, with login, and a Node.js backend shim.

The AngularJS frontend is wrapped in a WAR file so that it can easily be deployed in a tomcat container. Run `mvn clean install` to create the WAR.

Need to run npm install in the nodejs dir to get the modules in packages.json
